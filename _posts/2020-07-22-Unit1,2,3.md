## 3.Present Continuous and Simple Present (I am doing vs I do)



A - Compare

Present continuous ( I am doing ) <-> Simple present ( I do )

I'm getting hungry <-> I always get hungryin the afternoon



B - I always do vs I always doing

I always drive to work = I do it every time

I'm always losing thing  = I lose things very often
