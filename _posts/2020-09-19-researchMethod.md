<br/>

### 1.Literature Search

- 1.1 Web of Science
    • Previously known as Web of Knowledge.
    • It was originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI).
    • Currently maintained by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters).
    • Web of ScienceTM is the one of the most trusted publisher-independent global citation database.
    • WoS allows to track ideas across disciplines and time from almost 1.9 billion cited references from over 171 million records.
    • Citations are the formal, explicit linkages between papers that have particular points in common.

- 1.2 Microsoft Academic
    • Indexed an overview page that allow to easily explore top citing articles and references of the article.
    • Coverage : approx. 210 million articles
    • Abstracts
    • Related articles
    • References
    • Cited by
    • Links to full text
    • Export formats : APA, MLA, BibteX

- 1.3 BASE
    • Hosted at Bielefeld University in Germany
    • Coverage : approx. 136 million articles
    • Abstracts
    • No Related articles
    • No References
    • No Cited by
    • Links to full text
    • Export formats : RIS, BibTex

- 1.4 CORE
- 1.5 Science.gov
- 1.6 Semantic Scholar
- 1.7 Baidu Scholar

### 2.Why CITE?
- Ethics
    - Intellectual honesty
    - Attribution (tracking who said what when)
- Legal
    - Attribution
    - Copyright
- Research
    - Attribution
    - Evidence and support for authors’ claim  Evidence of state-of-the-art
- Confidence in author
    - Used as assessment of authors’ knowledge and understanding
- Reader convince
    - Helps the reader to refer to useful related research

- Attribution
    - The source of the idea
    - E.g. “according to the work done by [x]”
    - E.g. “as proved by x in [y]”
    - Citation: specification of the source location, include all necessary details req uired to obtain the source (e.g. author names, title, where published, year, page n umber, URLs, location and date for conferences)

### 3.Objectives
- Milestone of the research
- Follows logically from the vision
- Task oriented break-down of projected work
    - Task definition, one object to one task
    - Task organization, task interrelations
    - Task scheduling (Gannt Chart)
- Advantages
    - Novelty, uniqueness, benefit (economic, time, efficiency)
    - Measured against state-of-the-art and literature review 
- Methodology
    - Overall statement of advantages focused on process
    - Follows logically from task definition


### 4.Problem Statement
- What is the research problem you aim to solve?
- What is the central research question? (ie What do you want to find out?)
- What will we know after completion of your work that we did not know before? (i.e. What is novel?)
- Why does it matter? (i.e. Why should someone care about this research?)
- Requires understanding of research area
    - Literature review
    - Web, news, and popular reading
    - Advisers
    - Graduate level courses
    - Conferences (keynote, talks, and personal discussion)
- Requires statement of
    - Research context (research field / sub-field)
    - Significance
        - Application to real world
        - Benefit to human-kind, the world

### 5.Steps in defining a Problem
- Statement of the problem in a general way
- Understanding the nature of the problem
- Surveying the available literature
- Developing ideas through discussions
- Rephrasing the research problem

- Methodology
    - How do you (or plan to) conduct the research? Is it experimental or theoretical?
    - How will you know that you have succeeded? (What is your plan to demonstrate the validity of your claims?)
    - Explain briefly why your approach is appropriate in the context of your work. What alternatives would there be and why are you not using them?
- Related Work
    - Briefly summarise the 4 most important publications for your research.
    - How has this related work influenced your work?   
    - What is better (or different) in your work?

### 6.Professional Ethics
- Respect for intellectual property rights
- Academic honesty
- Give credit where credit is due
- Respect other’s contributions; evaluation of scholarship
    - E.g.: Graduate students accomplishing their degree by rightfully claiming their
contributions in print, Faculty rightfully claiming their contributions to support P&T.
- Promote a culture of mutual respect and contribution recognition: your contributions are like-wise to be recognized
- Correctly represent others’ works
- respectfully comment, review or critique others’ works
- Professional memberships
    - ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
    - IEEE Code of Ethics
