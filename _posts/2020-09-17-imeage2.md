### 2.1 Elements of visual perception

<br/>

2.1.1 Structure of the human eye
-choroid // lens // retina // fovea

2.1.2 Image formation in the eye
- optical cental
-the retinal image is focused primarily on the region of the fovea

2.1.3 Brightness adaptation and discrimination
-Perceiving brightness , Mach bands & simultaneous contrast

<br/>
<br/>


### 2.2 Light and the Electromagnetic spectrum

<br/>

-Electromagnetic waves can be visualized as propagating sinusoidal waves with wavelength

-Each bundle of energy is called a photon

-The colors that humans perceive in a object  are determined by the nature of the light reflected from the object

-Light that is void of color is called monochromatic light

<br/>
<br/>


### 2.3 Image sensing and acquisition

<br/>

2.3.1 Image acquisition using a single sensor
-Energy -> filter -> sensing material - voltage waveform out
2.3.2 Image acquisition using sensor strips
- Microdensitometers
2.3.3 Image acquisition using sensor arrays
-MRI , X-ray
2.3.4 A simple image formation mode
-Illumination source(energy) -> Scene element -> (Internal) image plane  -> output image( digitized)

<br/>
<br/>

### 2.4 image sampling and quantization

<br/>

2.4.1 Basic concepts in sampling and quantization
	-Sampling is digitizing the coordinate values, Digitizing the amplitude values is called quantization
2.4.2 Representing digital images
	-Spatial domain is the section of the real plane spanned by the coordinates of an image
	-We define the dynamic range of an imaging system to be the ratio of the maximum measurable intensity(saturation) to minimum 
detectable intensity(noise) level in the system
2.4.3 Spatial and intensity resolution
	-Dpi is Dots per unit distance which is a measure of image resolution used commonly in the printing and publishing industry
	-False contouring is the effect caused by the used of an insufficient number of intensity levels in smooth areas of a digital image
	-Isopreference curves is the generated results in the Nk-plane by varying N and k which are ranked them according to photo’s 
subjective quality 
2.4.4 Image interpolation
	-Interploation is a basic tool used extensively in task such as zooming, shrinking,rotating ,geometric corrections, and the process of 
using known data to estimated values at unknown location
    -Bilinear interpolation
    -Bicubic interpolation

### 2.5 Some basic relationships between pixels

<br/>


2.5.1 Neighbors of a pixe
    -A pixel p at coordinates has four horizontal and vertical neighbors 
    - 4-neighbors, 8-neighbors of p
2.5.2 Adjacency, Connectivity, Regions, and Boundaries
    -Inner border , outer border
    - R  be called region of the image . If R is a connected set, they be said to be Adjacent 
    -Edge is found frequently in discussions dealing with regions a boundaries
2.5.3 Distance Measures
    - p and q is defined in the Euclidean distance depends on m-Neighbors 


<br/>

### 2.6 An Introduction to the mathematical tools used in digital image processing

<br/>

2.6.1 array versus matrix operations - matrix [ , ] 
2.6.2 linear versus nonlinear operations - y = ax
2.6.3 Arithmetic operations - + , - , * ,  /
2.6.4 Set and Logical operations - Union, intersection ,OR , Xor etc
2.6.5 Spatial operations - rotating
2.6.6 Vector and Matrix operations
