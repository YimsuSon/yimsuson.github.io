### 9.1 Preliminaries
<br/>
9.1 Preliminaries
	-When working with images, we require that structuring elements be rectangular arrays.
	-This is accomplished by appending the smallest possible number of background elements necessary to from
	a rectangular array


<br/>
<br/>


### 9.2 Erosion and Dilation
<br/>


9.2.1 Erosion
	-We can view erosion as a morphological filtering operation in which image details smaller than the structuring element are filtered from the image
9.2.2 Dilation
	-The same image with broken characters that we studied in connection with lowpass filtering
9.2.3 Duality
	-It is useful particularly when the structuring element is symmetric with respect to its origin

<br/>
<br/>


### 9.3 Opening and Closing
<br/>


9.3 Opening and Closing
	-Opening generally smoothes the contour of an object, break narrow isthmuses and eliminates thin protrusion 
	-Closing tends to smooth sections of contours but, as opposed to opening, it generally fuses narrow breaks  


<br/>
<br/>


### 9.4 The Hit-or-Miss Transformation
<br/>

9.4 The Hit-or-Miss Transformation
	-It is basic tool for shape detection


<br/>
<br/>


### 9.5 Some Basic Morphological Algorithms
<br/>

9.5.1 Boundary Extraction
	-The boundary of a set A, denoted by b, can be obtained by first eroding A By B and then performing the set
	difference between A and its erosion.

9.5.2 Hole Filling
	-A hole may be defined as a background region surrounded by a connected border of foreground picels.

9.5.3 Extraction of Connected Components
	-Extraction of connected components from a binary image is central to many automated image analysis applications

9.5.4 Convex Hull
	-The convex hull H of an arbitrary set S is the smallest convex set containing S.

9.5.5 Thinning
	-The process is to thin A by one pass with B, then thin the result with one pass of B, and so on, until A is 
	thinned with one pass of B.

9.5.6 Thickening
	-It is the morphological dual of thinning and is defined by the expression where B is a structuring element
	suitable for thickening.

9.5.7 Skeletons
	-Morphology produces an elegant formulation in terms of erosions and openings of given set.

9.5.8 Pruning
	-Pruning methods are an essential complement to thinning an skeletonizing algorithms because these procedures tend to leave parasitic components that need to be “cleaned up” by postprocessing 

9.5.9 Morphological Reconstruction
	-It involves two images and structuring element. 
    -One image, the maker, contains the starting points for the transformation
    -The other image, the mask, constrains the transformation


<br/>
<br/>


### 9.6 Gray-scale Morphology
<br/>

9.6.1 Erosion and Dilation
	-The erosion of by a flat structuring element b at any location is defined as the minimum value of the image in the region coincident with b when the origin of b is at (x,y)

9.6.2 Opening and Closing
	-Opening and closing of images have a simple geometric interpretation.

9.6.3 Some Basic Gray Scale Morphological Algorithms
	-Morphological smoothing, Morphological gradient, Top-hat and bottom-hat transformations Granulometry, Textural segmentation

9.6.4 Gray-Scale Morphological Reconstruction
		-Gray scale morphological reconstruction is defined basically in the same manner introduced in Morphological Reconstruction
