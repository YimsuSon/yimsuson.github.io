### 1.What is data exploration?

- A preliminary exploration of the data to better understand its characteristics.
    - Key motivations of data exploration include
        - Helping to select the right tool for preprocessing or analysis
        - Making use of humans’ abilities to recognize patterns
            - People can recognize patterns not captured by data analysis tools
    - Related to the area of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        - Created by statistician John Tukey
        - Seminal book is Exploratory Data Analysis by Tukey
        - A nice online introduction can be found in Chapter 1 of the NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm

- Techniques Used In Data Exploration  

    - In EDA, as originally defined by Tukey
        - The focus was on visualization
        - Clustering and anomaly detection were viewed as exploratory techniques
        - In data mining, clustering and anomaly detection are major areas of interest, and not thought of as just exploratory

    - In our discussion of data exploration, we focus on
        - Summary statistics
        - Visualization
        - Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) 


- Iris Sample Data Set
    - Many of the exploratory data techniques are illustrated with the Iris Plant data set.
    - Can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html 
    - From the statistician Douglas Fisher
    - Three flower types (classes):
        - Setosa
        - Virginica 
        - Versicolour
    - Four (non-class) attributes
        - Sepal width and length
        - Petal width and length

### 2.Summary Statistics

- Summary statistics  are numbers that summarize properties of the data

    - Summarized properties include frequency, location and spread
        - Examples: 	location - mean                    	spread - standard deviation

    - Most summary statistics can be calculated in a single pass through the data


- Frequency and Mode
    - The frequency of an attribute value is the percentage of time the value occurs in the data set 
        - For example, given the attribute ‘gender’ and a representative population of people, the gender ‘female’ occurs about 50% of the time.
    - The mode of an attribute is the most frequent attribute value   
    - The notions of frequency and mode are typically used with categorical data


- Percentiles
    - For continuous data, the notion of a percentile is more useful. 

    - Given an ordinal or continuous attribute x and a number p between 0 and 100, the pth percentile is a value xp of x such that p% of the observed values of x are less than xp. 

    - For instance, the 50th percentile is the value x50% such that 50% of all values of x are less than x50%. 

- Measures of Location: Mean and Median

    - The mean is the most common measure of the location of a set of points.  
    - However, the mean is very sensitive to outliers.   
    - Thus, the median or a trimmed mean is also commonly used.


- Measures of Spread: Range and Variance

    - Range is the difference between the max and min
    - The variance or standard deviation sx is the most common measure of the spread of a set of points.  
    - Because of outliers, other measures are often used. 


### 3.Visualization

- 3.1 Representation
    - Visualization is the conversion of data into a visual or tabular format so that the characteristics of the data and the relationships among data items or attributes can be analyzed or reported.

    - Visualization of data is one of the most powerful and appealing techniques for data exploration. 

        - Humans have a well developed ability to analyze large amounts of information that is presented visually
        
        - Can detect general patterns and trends
        
        - Can detect outliers and unusual patterns   

    - Is the mapping of information to a visual format
    
    - Data objects, their attributes, and the relationships among data objects are translated into graphical elements such as points, lines, shapes, and colors.
    
    - Example: 
        - Objects are often represented as points
        - Their attribute values can be represented as the position of the points or the characteristics of the points, e.g., color, size, and shape
        - If position is used, then the relationships of points, i.e., whether they form groups or a point is an outlier, is easily perceived.





- 3.2 Arrangement

    - Is the placement of visual elements within a display
    - Can make a large difference in how easy it is to understand the data






Problem with large number of partitions
- Node impurity measures tend to prefer splits that result in large number of partitions, each being small but pure

    - Customer ID has highest information gain because entropy for all the children is zero

Gain Ratio: 
    - Adjusts Information Gain by the entropy of the partitioning (￼). 
        - Higher entropy partitioning (large number of small partitions) is penalized!
    - Used in C4.5 algorithm
    - Designed to overcome the disadvantage of Information Gain



- 3.3 Selection

    - Is the elimination or the de-emphasis of certain objects and attributes
    - Selection may involve the choosing a subset of attributes 
        - Dimensionality reduction is often used to reduce the number of dimensions to two or three
        - Alternatively, pairs of attributes can be considered
    - Selection may also involve choosing a subset of objects
        - A region of the screen can only show so many points
        - Can sample, but want to preserve points in sparse areas 


3.3.3 Measure of Impurity: Classification Error
- Classification error at a node ￼


    - Maximum of ￼when records are equally distributed among all classes, implying the least interesting situation
    - Minimum of 0 when all records belong to one class, implying the most interesting situation



Misclassification Error vs Gini Index




- 3.4 Techniques
    - Histograms

        - Usually shows the distribution of values of a single variable
        - Divide the values into bins and show a bar plot of the number of objects in each bin. 
        - The height of each bar indicates the number of objects
        - Shape of histogram depends on the number of bins

    - Two-Dimensional Histograms
        - Show the joint distribution of the values of two attributes 

    - Box Plots, Scatter Plots, Contour Plots, Matrix Plots

        - Box Plots 
            - Invented by J. Tukey
            - Another way of displaying the distribution of data 
            - Following figure shows the basic part of a box plot

        - Scatter plots 
            - Attributes values determine the position
            - Two-dimensional scatter plots most common, but can have three-dimensional scatter plots
            - Often additional attributes can be displayed by using the size, shape, and color of the markers that represent the objects 
            - It is useful to have arrays of scatter plots can compactly summarize the relationships of several pairs of attributes
    

        - Contour plots 
            - Useful when a continuous attribute is measured on a spatial grid
            - They partition the plane into regions of similar values
            - The contour lines that form the boundaries of these regions connect points with equal values	
            - The most common example is contour maps of elevation
            - Can also display temperature, rainfall, air pressure, etc.

        - Matrix plots 
            - Can plot the data matrix
            - This can be useful when objects are sorted according to class
            - Typically, the attributes are normalized to prevent one attribute from dominating the plot	
            - Plots of similarity or distance matrices can also be useful for visualizing the relationships between objects

    - Parallel Coordinates

        - Parallel Coordinates 
            - Used to plot the attribute values of high-dimensional data
            - Instead of using perpendicular axes, use a set of parallel axes 
            - The attribute values of each object are plotted as a point on each corresponding coordinate axis and the points are connected by a line	
            - Thus, each object is represented as a line 
            - Often, the lines representing a distinct class of objects group together, at least for some attributes
            - Ordering of attributes is important in seeing such groupings


        - Star Plots 
            - Similar approach to parallel coordinates, but axes radiate from a central point
            - The line connecting the values of an object is a polygon

        - Chernoff Faces
            - Approach created by Herman Chernoff
            - This approach associates each attribute with a characteristic of a face
            - The values of each attribute determine the appearance of the corresponding facial characteristic	
            - Each object becomes a separate face
            - Relies on human’s ability to distinguish faces



    - Star Plots, Chernoff faces 

        - On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) was proposed by E. F. Codd, the father of the relational database.
        - Relational databases put data into tables, while OLAP uses a multidimensional array representation. 
        - Such representations of data previously existed in statistics and other fields
        - There are a number of data analysis and data exploration operations that are easier with such a data representation.
