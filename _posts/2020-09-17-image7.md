### 5.1 A Model of the Image Degradation/Restoration process

<br/>


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.2 Noise Models 

<br/>

5.2.1 Spatial and Frequency properties of noise
    -CCD camera, light levels and sensor temperature are major factors affecting the amount of noise in the resulting image

5.2.2 Some Important Noise probability density functions
	-Gaussian noise , Rayleigh noise, Erlang noise , Exponential noise, Uniform noise, Impulse noise

5.2.3 Periodic Noise
	-Periodic noise in an image arises from electrical or electromechanical interference during image acquisition

5.2.4 Estimation of Noise parameters
	-The parameters of periodic noise are estimated by inspection of the Fourier spectrum of the image


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.3 Restoration in the presence of noise only-spatial filtering

<br/>


5.3.1 Mean filters
	-Arithmetic mean filter, Geometric mean filter, Harmonic mean filter, Contraharmonic mean filter
5.3.2 Order statistic filters
	-Median filter, Max and min filters, Midpoint filter, Alpha-trimmed mean filter

5.3.3 Adaptive filters
	-Adaptive, local noise reduction filter, Adaptive median filter, 

<br/>
<br/>


### 5.4 Periodic noise reduction by frequency domain filtering  

<br/>



5.4.1 Bandreject filters
	-Bandreject filtering is for noise removal in applications where the general location of the noise component 

5.4.2 Bandpass filters
	-It performs the opposite operation of a bandreject filter

5.4.3 Notch filters
	-A notch filter rejects frequencies in predefined neighborhoods about a center frequency

5.4.4 Optimum notch filtering
	- It minimize local variances of the restored estimate

<br/>
<br/>


### 5.5 Linear, Position invariant degradations

<br/>


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.6 Estimating the degradation function

<br/>

5.6 Estimating the degradation function
5.6.1 Estimation by image observation

5.6.2 Estimation by Experimentation

5.6.3 Estimation by modeling


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.7 Inverse filtering

<br/>


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.8 Minimum mean square error filtering


<br/>


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.9 Constrained least squares filtering


<br/>


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.10 Geometric mean filter

<br/>


<br/>
<br/>


### 5.11 Image reconstruction from projections
