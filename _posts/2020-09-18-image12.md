### 12.1 Pattern and Pattern Classes
<br/>



<br/>
<br/>

### 12.2 Recognition Based on Decision - Theoretic Methods
<br/>
12.2.1 Matching
	-Minimum distance classifier
	-Matching by correlation

12.2.2 Optimum Statistical Classifiers
    -Probability consideration become important in pattern recognition because of the randomness under which pattern classes are  generated



<br/>
<br/>

### 12.3 Structural Methods
<br/>


12.2.3 Neural Networks
	-Perceptron for two pattern classes
	-Training algorithms
	-Multilayer feedforward neural networks

12.3.1 Matching Shape Numbers
	-The degree of similarity between two region boundaries is defined as the largest order for which their shape numbers still coincide

12.3.2 String Matching
	-String were formed from the polygons by computing the interior angle between segments as each polygon was traversed clockwise
