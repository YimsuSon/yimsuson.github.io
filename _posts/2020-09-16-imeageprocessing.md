### 1.1 What is digital image processing?

low level process - reducing noise, contrast enhancement, image sharpening
Mid level process - segmentation
High level process - recognized object



<br/>
<br/>

### 1.3 Examples of Fields that Used Digital Image processing

<br/>

1.3.1 Gamma-Ray Imaging - nuclear medicine , astronomical observation

<br/>

1.3.2 X-ray Imaging  -  computerized axial tomography ,circuit board , astronomy

<br/>

1.3.3 Imaging in the Ultraviolet band - fluorescence microscopy

<br/>

1.3.3 Imaging in the Visible and Infrared bands - remote sensing , automated inspection of manufactured good

<br/>

1.3.4 Imaging in the Microwave Band - radar

<br/>

1.3.5 Imaging in the Radio Band - magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)

<br/>

1.3.7 Examples in which other imaging modalities are used- ultrasound, soundwave, reflected wave, calculateing distance




<br/>
<br/>

### 1.4 Fundamental Steps in Digital Image processing

<br/>

Image restoration - improving the appearance of an image.


<br/>


Color image processing - gaining in importance , the basis for extracting features of interest in an image.


<br/>

Wavelets - foundation for representing images in various degrees of resolution.

<br/>

Morphological processing - Extracting image components that are useful in the representation and description of shape

<br/>

Segmentaion - Proceduring partition an image into its constituent parts or objects

<br/>

Recognition - the process that assigns a label to an object based on its descriptors
