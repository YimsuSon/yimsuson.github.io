### 7.1 Background

<br/>

7.1.1 Image Pyramids
	-An image pyramid is collection of decreasing resolution images arranged in the shape of a pyramid

7.1.2 Subband Coding
	-In subband coding, An image is decomposed into a set of bandlimited components, called subbands.
	-The decomposition is performed so that the subbands can be reassembled to reconstruct the original image with out error

7.1.3 The Haar Transform
	-It is basis function, the oldest and simplest known orthonormal wavelets


<br/>
<br/>

### 7.2 Multiresolution Expansions

<br/>

7.2.1 Series Expansions
	-Functions are used to encode the difference in information between adjacent approximations
	-Expansion set , φ(x), is calle  a basis for the class of function that can be so expressed 
    -The expressible functions form a function space that is referred to as the closed span of the expansion set, denoted V= span{ φ(x) }
    -The a coefficient are computed by integral inner products      a = < φ(x) ,f(x) > = ∫ φ(x) ,f(x) dx


7.2.2 Scaling Functions
	-φ(x) is called a scaling function.
	-By choosing φ(x) , { φj,k(x)} can be made to span L^2 (R) which is the set of all measurable, square -integrable functions
	-Using the notation of the previous section, we can define that subspace as V = Span {φj,k(x) }

7.2.2 Wavelet Functions 
	-We can define a wave function Ψj,k(x) that together with its integertranslates an binary scaling, spans the difference between 
any two adjacent scaling subspaces V 
	-We define the set {Ψj,k(x)} of wavelets, {Ψj,k(x)} = 2^j/2 Ψ (2^j x  - k)
	-Wj = span {Ψj,k(x)}
	-Vj+1 =  Vj ⨁ Wj       *Oplus is the union of space

### 7.3 Wavelet Transform in One Dimension


<br/>


7.3.1 The Wavelet Series Expansions
	-It’s counter parts in the Fourier domain are the Fourier series expansion

7.3.2 The Discrete Wavelet Transform
	-It’s counter parts in the Fourier domain are the discrete Fourier transform

7.3.3 The Continuous Wavelet Transform
	-It’s counter parts in the Fourier domain are the integral Fourier transform


<br/>
<br/>

### 7.4 The Fast Wavelet Transform

<br/>
    -The fast wavelet transform is a computationally efficient implementation of the discrete wavelet transform that exploits a surprising	

<br/>
<br/>

### 7.5 Wavelet Transforms in Two Dimensions

<br/>
    -The results yields the scale j+1 approximation, an the process is repeated until the original image is reconstructed


<br/>
<br/>

### 7.6 Wavelet Packets

<br/>
    -The fast wavelet transform decomposes a function into a sum of scaling and wavelet functions whose bandwidths are logarithmically related.
